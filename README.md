# hello-world
My very first repository

Hi all,

This is Likun Lin, an optical engineer working in the high speed optical communication area to build the next generation optical networks. Apart from my optics work, I'm interested in analyzing data, building model to see the insights and solve problems. I plan to participate projects including data science and machine learning in Github.
